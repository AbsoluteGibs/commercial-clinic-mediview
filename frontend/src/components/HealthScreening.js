            <p>At MEDIVIEW CLINIC & SURGERY we strive to provide affordable and tailored health screening packages.</p>
            <p>Health screening is essential for the early detection of diseases and conditions, many of which do not produce early warning sign. Some of these can be silent killers such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancers.</p>
            <p>With early detection and good management of these chronic conditions, complications can be avoided or delayed.</p>
            <p>With so many health screening packages to choose from, our doctors are committed to work with you to stratify your risk and to choose a package most suitable for you.</p>
            <p>It is never too late to start health screening. Please contact us for more information.</p>
            <p>(It is better to have an appointment for health screening as it will make the process smoother. Please fast for at least 8 hours before your health screening with only plain water allowed. For those on daily medication, please continue your medication except for diabetic medication or medication that may cause gastritis or discuss with our doctor before doing so.)</p>
