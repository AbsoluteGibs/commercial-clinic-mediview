                Non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (e.g. Sinovac) may be suitable for individuals who are unable to get inoculated with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, they still come with risks of side effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore said the protection Sinovac provides against newer variants, such as the delta variant, and under real-world conditions remains unknown.
            </p>
            <p>
                The expert committee said the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, which are currently the only two available under Singapore's national vaccination programme, have consistently shown to be highly efficacious, with an efficacy rate of around 90 per cent.
            </p>
            <p>
                No vaccine provides 100 per cent protection, and with the emergence and spread of new variants due to mutations, infections can occur despite vaccination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternate vaccines (e.g. Sinovac) are not part of the national vaccine programme.
